# employee-directory

A front-end only React application that allows the user to view an employee directory. Table functionality includes:

* Search
* Sort
* Filter
    
The user can click on the specific column of choice to sort by that information. If clicked, it is sorted alphabetically ascendingly, and if clicked again it is sorted descendingly. The search filter is applied to all fields and returns any values that match.
